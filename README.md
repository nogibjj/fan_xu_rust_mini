### Data

historical_projections.csv contains historical results of the NBA draft projection model, 2001-2015.

The dataset contains the data behind the story [Projecting The Top 50 Players In The 2015 NBA Draft Class](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/projecting-the-top-50-players-in-the-2015-nba-draft-class/). It can be accessed [here](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/nba-draft-2015)


# User Guide

To use this CLI, first clone this git repo. To install Cargo, use the following command:

`curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh`

Check if the installation was successful with 

`cargo --version`

Once Cargo has been installed, you can compile the file with (make sure you are inside the sqlite directory)

`cargo build --release`

To begin using the CLI, add the compiled binary with the following command, replacing the path with the location of the sqlite binary file

`export PATH=$PATH:/<Path>/sqlite/target/release`

Once the compiled binary has been added to your path, you can use the CLI with the following commands:
